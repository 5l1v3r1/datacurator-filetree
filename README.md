Hello and Welcome to the [r/datacurator](https://reddit.com/r/datacurator) Filetree Repository.  

We aim to create a unified filetree for all kinds of data.

**Notes for Contributors**


You are free to push changes into the wip (Work-In-Progress) Branch.  
Please Note that git needs at least 1 file in the last directory that is created in a tree.  
(e.g.: if you create /documents/my/new/folder/here/ there needs to be a file under "here/".)
