# Branch: *Collected*
A FileTree for r/datacurator

Hello and Welcome to the [r/datacurator](https://reddit.com/r/datacurator) Filetree Repository.  

This is the *Collected* Branch - Therefore there is no actual filetree in here, but resources, examples, links and stuff. Maybe I should rename this ro "resources", but currently it's just gathjered information.
