A FileTree for r/datacurator

Hello and Welcome to the [r/datacurator](https://reddit.com/r/datacurator) filetree repository.  

We aim to create a unified filetree for all kinds of data. 



## Some Links for starters

* [\*nix Filesystem Hierarchy](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard)  

* [Media Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media#Communications)

* [Universal Decimal Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Decimal_Classification)

  

## Notes for Contributors

- If your are confident with the changes,

  push changes into the `wip` (Work-In-Progress) branch.

- If you want to share your personal filetree,

  create your own user-branch: `user/nickname`



**Basic Guidelines:**

* start with a *root* directory (`/root`)

* create your folder structure (e.g. `/root/foo/bar`)

* make sure the deeply nested folder contains at least one placeholder file:

  `/root/foo/bar/example.doc`

* add notes with markdown â†’ `README.md` / `notes.md` / `media.md`
