## TV-Shows

**Things to consider:**

* Merging TV Series with Anime and Animated Content, since they both are broadcasted on national TV, as well as on VOD Services.
* use internationalized name. ('Shingeki No Kyojin' is 'Attack on Titan')
* CAN be split further if people like to split their libraries. (Anime/Cartoon/TV/Kids/..)
* Appending Years is almost always a good Idea (as with movies) - there might be multiple variants.. (Matching with DB seems to be a bit off though..)


There is a good reason why Anime is often split - because the Naming differs in a kinda uncomfortable way. See Attack on Titan For Example - Season 2 is actually considered a new Series and Just named as "season 2". But at the Same Time the Episode Count just keeps going up instead of being reset.  

Sherlock on the other Hand has a Classic Season / Episode Structure that is much easier to follow.  

* We need to find a structure that either sqauashes one into the other, or keep it seperate.
