## Video

**Things to consider:**

*There is a wide range of Video-types:*

Movies, Movie Shorts, Music Videos, Tv-Shows, Documentaries, learning/tutorials, webisodes, dvd extras (making of), real-live captures, vlogs, let's play, and more..  

The most important are probably Movies and TV-Shows


* Should not be splitted too far
* TV Shows and Anime ? Together in 1 Directory or splitted?
* TV Shows and Web-Series (Youtube Series, inofficial stuff) - splitted?
