***Note: Heavily WIP**

**Common Literature:**

- Books/Novels
- Comics (At least I think it is part of literature)
- Poems/Poetry
- Theatre/Plays
- Manifestos
- Short Stories

## Modern Books:

* Check https://bookbrainz.org for Proper Author/Title Naming
* Include ISBN (10 or 13) similar to Music Releases
* Example: J.K. Rowling - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone [English] {1408845644}
* ISBN-10 can be expanded to ISBN-13 by adding 978: {978-1408845646}

**Naming Ideas:**

	└── Lastname, Firstname
		└── Firstname Lastname - [Book Series #] - Book Title {ISBN}.ext
		
## Non-Fiction / All kinds of Books
There are several classification systems for libraries to sort and catalog books. (See Wikipedia Link on Library Classification)
In this repository, we want to use such a system and provide examples on how that would be applicable.
